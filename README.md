## Overview
I implemented the poject with media query in order to fit different size of screen. There are two different sizes, one fits for the laptop screen, while another one fits for the mobile.

## bug
The nav bar and the dropdown list may be a little bit overflow in small laptop screens. As my understanding I would like to use flexbox structure instead of media query to implement the responsive design again.

## improvement
In order to make the responsive design, I implemented the nav bar as a dropdown list when the screen is smaller as a mobile app. In this way it makes the view much more clear and easy to use.
